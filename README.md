# tf-classifier-catsdogs
Final project made for IDTech summer course in 2019, classifies and predicts whether an object is a cat or dog.
The five files in this project correspond to different stages of the project. v4 is the newest but v3 is the most succesful, with v5 being an updated version of v3 to silence TensorFlow's compatibility warnings. That issue is currently in progress.
The final goal of this project is to get to a reasonable 99% accuracy metric.
## file notes
The files in this project are sourced from a famous [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).
